**Problem?** Cities struggle to track their engagement efforts or measure how community use of open data can improve relationships between residents and government.

**Solution/Intervention?** Cities proactively conduct and track community engagement efforts that lead to quantifiable outputs and ongoing relational engagement between City and residents.

**Expected Impact?** Communities are more civically engaged, using open data as a means to understand local issues, advocate and hold local governments accountable.
