The [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/), which is managed by the University of Pittsburgh in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, sees community engagement as an essential component of its work. As a data intermediary, WPRDC manages open data on behalf of the city, county, and other partners, while also helping people “find and use information to improve their communities.”  

Bob Gradeck, the Project Director of WPRDC, says that despite having a small team, they still dedicate a decent amount of time doing outreach, having meetings with partners, and hosting office hours. According to Gradeck, there’s really no better way of learning about how communities are using their data unless they’re out there, engaging with users.

We applied our [community engagement impact framework](/action/impact-framework/) to summarize and assess the potential outcomes and impacts of WPRDC’s engagement work, which they already carefully track with the [performance metrics dashboard](https://tools.wprdc.org/analytics/wprdc-dashboard/).

## 4/5. Outcomes and Impacts

An obvious outcome from WPRDC’s engagement work is the fact that they have a strong sense of who is using their data and why. Having this understanding allows them to continually assess the longer term influence they have on the individuals and organizations using their data, and this in turn helps them evaluate their impact.

Unfortunately, we do not have available a list of specific outcomes and impacts for Pittsburgh/WPRDC — but we hope that the content above still gives a sense of how this framework might be applied. To see more potential outcomes and impacts of this type of work, take a look at [our impact framework](/action/impact-framework/) and our [Louisville application of the framework](/action/impact-framework/louisville/).
