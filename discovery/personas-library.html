      <p>This library tracks and collects currently existing user personas, a human-centered design tool that open data programs are beginning to use to understand their users and communicate about their needs and behaviors. User personas are informative <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/01/31/how-open-data-can-support-equitable-and-complete-neighborhoods-in-madison-wi-our-third-pilot-of-tactical-data-engagement/">user research composites</a>. When technologists design open data portals, they can use personas as a tool to keep in mind how real people might approach their product.</p>
      <p>Each set of personas in the library varies in granularity according to need &mdash; from sector-specific departmental initiatives to citywide objectives, to regional collaboration and data sharing. Open data user personas are a valuable product of and asset to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/methodology/#step-2-refine">Refine stage</a> of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/methodology/">Tactical Data Engagement framework</a>.</p>
