The challenge is knowing <em>which</em> data to share and <em>how</em> to share it. We’ve assembled the following strategies to help data providers find the right issue to tackle with open data, and to dive deeper into understanding residents’ information needs.</h3>

      <h2>Understanding data users</h2>
      <p>Understanding data users is central to a user-centered approach to open data. Consider both current and potential data users, as well as community stakeholders.</p>
      <p>User personas are fictional characters, but their characteristics are assembled from patterns across interviews with community members. This makes them useful in understanding residents and the roles, needs, and challenges of potential open data users.</p>
      <p>Developing user personas can be an iterative process, building on research and design sprints according to the capacity and objectives of each individual program. Cities should create their own personas by conducting ethnographic research and synthesizing qualitative evidence into prototypes. If not immediately feasible, it may be optimal to workshop internal insights to create preliminary personas before investing in dedicated user research.</p>
