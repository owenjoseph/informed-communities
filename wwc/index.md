# Build a government residents can count on

The Sunlight Foundation’s [Open Cities team](https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/open-cities/) partners with Bloomberg Philanthropies’ [What Works Cities](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/) (WWC) initiative to help local governments improve residents’ lives by using data and evidence effectively to tackle pressing challenges. We do this by supporting U.S. cities to become more data-driven and data-democratized.

Whether you’re just starting out on developing an open data policy, or you’re ready to dive deeper into engaging and mobilizing your community with open data, the Roadmap to Informed Communities has resources that can help you work toward [WWC Certification](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/certification/), the national standard of excellence for well-managed, data-driven local government.

Certification, which is open to any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more, helps local governments benchmark their progress and develop a roadmap for using data and evidence to deliver results for residents.

Completing a [Certification assessment](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4620807/NEW-2018-Certification-Application) is the first step to participating in the program. Doing so makes your city eligible for a wide range of support from WWC, from access to the initiative’s learning network to the receipt of targeted technical assistance from WWC’s expert partners, including our team at Sunlight.
