  With this initiative in mind, the Office of Technology and Innovation asked civic design
  firm Reboot to find out who the current and potential users of open data are. Reboot then
  conducted research to design personas, which helped to identify a pipeline from current

  2 million residents, one of MORPC’s core roles is as a data intermediary that collects data from and provides data
  to partners throughout the region. Endeavoring to gauge user needs at the regional level, they carried out an extensive
  research project that culminated in a set of Central Ohio data user personas. The personas are designed to help MORPC,

  description: "In recent years, flooding has become a persistent issue in Norfolk — making
  major roads inaccessible even when the city is not experiencing weather-related flooding
  emergencies, which can destroy property and cause backlogs in services. The City of Norfolk
  was eager to see how their new open data program could help respond to these issues, and
  reached out to the Sunlight Foundation to find a community-centered open data solution.
  The City used Tactical Data Engagement methods to support those residents working to
  address flooding and build a more resilient Norfolk."
