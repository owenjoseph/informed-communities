# Roadmap to Informed Communities

This repository powers the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/)’s [Roadmap to Informed Communities website](https://communities.sunlightfoundation.com/), which offers tools for community-centered approaches to open data.

The site began using a fork of [18F’s website](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov) — with that as a base for design and functionality — and was then heavily customized to become what it is today. (This decision was inspired by the [similar approach](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-planninglabs.nyc-archive/blob/master/_posts/2017-06-12-cloning-18f-gsa-gov.md) taken by NYC Planning Labs.)
